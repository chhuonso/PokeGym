<h2>Hello and welcome to my PokeGym project!</h2>

&nbsp; &nbsp; This project concept allows users to have a unique gym experience. Initially, gym members are able to collect pokemon characters once they arrive and check in. After every 24 hours, each member will be rewarded a random generated pokemon - this is added to their collection. Members are also given the option to either trade or give away pokemon with other members. While at the gym, members can connect and help each other grow, make new friends, and socialize. The idea is to break the ice for individuals that are shy, but is on a journey to getting into shape. So, lets invite a fellow member to have fun while getting fit, collect pokemon, and build unity. 

This project was built using Python, Flask, Jinja, and MySQL Workbench.
